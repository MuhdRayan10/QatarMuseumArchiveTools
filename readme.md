# R3D to MP4 Conversion Interface

This part of the repo contains a **Python** utility to batch-convert **RED `.R3D`** camera files into **H.264 `.mp4`** files via an intermediate **ProRes** (.mov) data file. It creates a new directory containing the converted files in the exact same structure as the source directory.

## Prerequisites

* **Windows or macOS** with access to terminal.
* **Python 3.8+**
* **REDCINEâ€‘X Pro** (provides the `redline` CLI tool).
* **FFmpeg** (for converting `.mov` into `.mp4`).
* **Python packages**: `PyQt6`, `ffmpeg-python`

```bash
pip install ffmpeg-python
```

## Functions To Get Used To

* **`r3d_to_mov(input_path, output_dir)`**: Converts a single `.R3D` clip to a `.mov` using REDline.
* **`mov_to_mp4(input_path)`**: Re-encodes the `.mov` into `.mp4` with the help of `ffmpeg-python`.
* **`convert_file(input_path, output_dir)`**: Handles the complete process of `.R3D` to `.mp4` file conversion while removing any intermediate files.
* **`convert_directory(input_dir)`**: Recursively processes all `.R3D` files in `input_dir`, and creates a new directory of similar structure containing the converted files.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhdRayan10/QatarMuseumArchiveTools
   cd QatarMuseumArchiveTools
   ```
2. **Install Python dependencies** (none so far, but in case):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Confirm that `redline` and `ffmpeg`** are working from your shell (if not, update your `PATH`):

   ```bash
   which redline
   which ffmpeg
   ```

## Usage


### Command Line

Import the functions in `r3d.py` to integrate conversion into your own scripts.
For example:

```python
from r3d import convert_directory
convert_directory("/path/to/r3d/files")
```

### Graphical Interface

Run `python r3d_gui.py` to launch a simple GUI built with **PyQt6**. The
interface allows you to:

1. Browse for the folder containing `.R3D` clips.
2. Choose a compression ratio (1, 2, 4 or 8).
3. Set the number of worker threads used during conversion.
4. Monitor progress in real time via a progress bar and log output.
5. View statistics such as data processed, conversion rate and estimated time
   remaining.

Closing the window while a conversion is running will stop the workers
gracefully.


## Customisability

Will add features that can help users tweak the quality of the conversion, and many other things. A GUI is also being developed.
